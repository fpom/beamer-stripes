# Warming Stripes beamer theme

This is a theme for LaTeX/beamer, based on the original default theme with basic changes:

 * insert the [warming stripes](https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2018/warming-stripes/) as headline background
 * redefine default colours for titles, alerts, etc., to match the stripes
 * redefine the content of headline

See file `test.tex` for an example, and `test.pdf` for its PDF rendering.
